Issues:
Current WeeklyViewWidget and WeeklyActivitySummaryWidget implementations use an excessive amount of API calls, making the window load too slowly.
WeeklyActivitySummaryWidget currently makes a call for each individual gpx and csv file, for each activity, for each day.
Better would be to make on API call for the week to retrieve all the activities. They can then be sorted into sublists for each day, with sublists being passed to WeeklyViewWidget.

Future:
Fix issue with excessive API calls - Would still need individual calls for gpx and csv files, so changes would only reduce by 4-5 calls to get activity ids, putting fix on hold
Should time api calls to see how necessary
Change may still be necessary to make it easier to do totals
Add Categories and Totals widget to WeeklyViewWidget, categories would be easier by parameterising csv categoires
Add context menu to WeeklyActivitySummaryWidget about right clicking through, or left clicking to select
Add ActivityViewWidget using MapWidget
